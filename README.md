# TriviaGame

This is a simple multiple choice trivia game with a timer.
The user clicks on the start button and the quiz is displayed and they have 2 minutes to complete 6 questions. Which seems like a lot of time, I'm not going to lie, and they aren't that hard of questions. When the user is done they click on the done button and the quiz disappears and their score page is displayed. Or, the timer runs out and the same function is executed.
